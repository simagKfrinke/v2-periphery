## What is OraDump Export Kit 4.1?
 
OraDump Export Kit 4.1 is a software pack developed by Intelligent Converters[^1^], a company that specializes in database conversion and synchronization solutions. OraDump Export Kit 4.1 consists of several tools that can export data from Oracle dump files into various databases and formats. The tools are:
 
- OraDump-to-Access: converts Oracle dump files into MS Access format.
- OraDump-to-CSV: converts Oracle dump files into CSV (comma separated values) format.
- OraDump-to-Excel: converts Oracle dump files into MS Excel format.
- OraDump-to-MSSQL: migrates Oracle dump files to MS SQL server.
- OraDump-to-MySQL: migrates Oracle dump files to MySQL server.
- OraDump-to-Oracle: imports Oracle dump files to Oracle server.
- OraDump-to-PostgreSQL: migrates Oracle dump files to PostgreSQL server.

All versions of Oracle dump files are supported (both EXP and EXPDP). The program has high performance because it reads dump files directly and does not use ODBC or any other middleware software. Command line support allows to script, automate and schedule the conversion process. You can also customize types mapping and select certain columns to convert in some tools. Encrypted dump files are also supported.

To export data from Oracle dump files with OraDump Export Kit 4.1, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install OraDump Export Kit 4.1 from the official website[^2^]. You can try the demo version that converts only 50 records per table or buy the full version that has no limitations.
2. Launch the tool that corresponds to the destination format or database you want to export data to. For example, if you want to export data to MS Access, launch OraDump-to-Access.
3. Select the Oracle dump file you want to export data from. You can also specify the schema name if the dump file contains multiple schemas.
4. Select the tables you want to export data from. You can also filter data by SQL queries or select certain columns to convert.
5. Select the destination file or database where you want to export data to. You can also specify the connection settings and other options depending on the tool you are using.
6. Click "Convert" button to start the conversion process. You can see the progress and logs on the screen.
7. Once the conversion is completed, you can check the results in the destination file or database.

You can also use the command line interface of OraDump Export Kit 4.1 to run the conversion without GUI. You need to create a profile file that contains all the conversion settings and then execute it with the tool name as a parameter. For example, if you want to run OraDump-to-Access with a profile file named "access.prf", you need to type this command:
  ```bash oradump2access.exe access.prf ```  
You can find more details about the command line syntax and options in the help file of each tool.
